metadescription: 'Manage factions and campaign pools in the Moxie tabletop RPG system to create a living world, track goals, and drive off-screen developments.'

Track off-screen developments of major forces, creating a feeling of a living world beyond the PCs. They have:

- **Resources** that show their power and influence, like assets, traits and relationships.
- **Goals** that show their ambitions. Track each with a timer called a **faction pool**, rolled between sessions or when triggered by events in the story.

When a faction pool depletes, the goal is either accomplished or they make their move against another faction, with a story roll in their favor determining how it plays out.

Keep 4-6 active factions, balancing major and minor ones, with competing goals. Replace factions that are no longer relevant to the story.

## Campaign Pools

Timers that pace long-term events across sessions. They work like faction pools but don't require faction details. Use them to signal upcoming events or remind you to reintroduce plotlines.

## Examples

- **Faction**

  - **Resources**: _Leadership, Money, Assets_
  - **Goals**: _4d Get Thing, 6d Do Thing_

- **Campaign Pool**

  - **Resources**: _Stuff That Makes Things Happen_
  - **Goals**: _4d Thing Happens, 6d Other Thing Happens_
