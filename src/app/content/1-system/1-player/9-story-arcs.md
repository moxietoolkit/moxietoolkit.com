Evocative phrases that give your PC and group a thematic direction. Find out where they lead through play - they're a starting direction, not the destination.

Pick a **group arc** together, then a **character arc**. Pick from the examples or write your own. Keep it short.

| Ambitions             | Struggles             | Growth            |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------- |
| _Build a Reputation_  | _Come Unraveled_      | _Embrace Change_  |
| _Explore the World_   | _Doubt Convictions_   | _Escape My Past_  |
| _Finish the Missions_ | _Feed My Vices_       | _Find Belonging_  |
| _Make Things Right_   | _Flirt with Betrayal_ | _Just Enjoy Life_ |
| _Satisfy Desires_     | _Keep a Secret_       | _Prove Myself_    |
| _Uncover the Truth_   | _Survive the Storm_   | _Settle Debts_    |

**_Take a spark by resolving an arc_** with a meaningful moment, _however big or small it is_. This could mean achieving your goal, adjusting for the next step, or moving on from it entirely.

Group arc unite players around a theme, while character arcs help you express your own story. Most importantly, they give you authorial power - you can use story or tangles to add story details tied to your arcs to bring them into play!

Story arcs signal to the GM that you want **_drama, dilemmas_** and **_opportunities_** to rise around them. Aim to resolve arcs within 3-5 sessions to keep things fresh. For struggles, get group permission - limiting them to a few sessions and involving everyone makes it fun.
