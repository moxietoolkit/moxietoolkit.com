## Pre-Session Recap

Before each session (afterthe first), recall the previous session and share your PC's best moment. **_Each player takes spark._** When all are finished, the GM **recaps** (_taking suspense_) tying all of these moments together into a proper _"Previously on..."_ and starts the session.

**_Note_**_: Spark carries over and story resets each session._

## Post-Session XP

After each session, **_take 1 XP_** and fill in its box. You start at level 1 and advance when you fill boxes equal to the next level _(Lvl. 4 to Lvl. 5 means 5 more boxes)_. This lets you choose a **_new talent_**.

**_The GM can award 1 bonus XP for a standout session_** _(about 1 in 4)_. For a slower pace, slash each XP box before filling it.
