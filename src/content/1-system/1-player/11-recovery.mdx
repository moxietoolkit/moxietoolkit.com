## Healing

**_When you get bloodied or rattled, start a 4d pool_** to track its healing. When you **heal** harm from rest, treatment, or another source, roll the pool. At 0d, clear the harm. **_Treatment_** requires _time, tools, training_ and carries risk, and each pool can benefit from treatment only a single time.

**_Marks can't benefit from treatment_**. They are light enough already that only time heals them. They can only be cleared with rest, talents or rolling.

## Rest

A stretch of time between significant action. Paced for drama, not realism. Clear all marks and heal (roll pools).

## Downtime

Extended breaks. Fully heal and reset per-session talents. The GM rolls faction pools. After, they pick and deplete one to move the story forward. You can roll a montage to achieve something non-pivotal.
