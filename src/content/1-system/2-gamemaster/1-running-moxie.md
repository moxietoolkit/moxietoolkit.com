As the GM, you play the game by a different set of rules, utilizing the tools laid out in this chapter to craft an engaging and dynamic game. You wield GM moves and suspense to drive the narrative forward, challenges to model difficult tasks, the combat kit to create thrilling battles, and story rolls along with the GM crucible for inspiration when the unexpected arises.

Your primary role is mapping fiction to mechanics, keeping the players immersed in the story while you seamlessly weave the rules into the narrative, and know when to instead ditch a rule and just let the narrative take over.

Above all, be creative. Use the mechanics as a springboard to manufacture drama, tension, and memorable moments.
