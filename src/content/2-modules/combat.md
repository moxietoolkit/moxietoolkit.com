## Combat Kit

GM tools to create dynamic **_antagonists_** and **_combat scenarios_** quickly. **Tier** is an opponent's threat level. **Role** is a keyword used to guide its behavior in battle to vary its tactics. **Battlegrounds** make the environment a proactive or obstacle-ridden part of the scene. Mix these for dynamic combats.

### Tiers

- **Mook**
  - Mostly just _set dressing_.
  - One action roll can take out several.
  - Large groups can be a task pool.
- **Tough**
  - A typical, dangerous enemy.
  - One action roll can take out one of them.
  - Small groups can be a task pool.
- **Elite**
  - Strong scene presence.
  - A 4d/6d challenge.
  - Often leads a group of lesser enemies.
- **Boss**
  - Commands the scene.
  - A 6d/8d challenge or linked challenge.
  - Extremely powerful.

### Roles

- **Blaster**
- **Brute**
- **Lurker**
- **Marksman**
- **Overseer**
- **Marauder**
- **Predator**
- **Protector**

### Battleground

Make the location an important, proactive part of the scene. Identify environmental elements to bring into play.

- **Features**: Elements likely to impact, usually complicating, the ongoing action. _They have a strong effect on vantage and difficulty_.
- **Threats**: Hazards that present extra dangers. They either get 2 suspense or repeat on a timer. _They have a strong proactive presence in the scene_.

### Example

**Note**: Enemies gathered into a single task pool are listed with the dice in front _(4d Enemies)_. Challenges are shown with a | after the pool _(8d | Challenge)_.

- **_Battleground_**
  - **Features**: _Dangerous Feature #1, Dangerous Feature #2_
  - **Threats**: _4d Threat_, _2 suspense for Bigger Threat_
  - **Challenges**:
    - 4d Random Guys _(Mook Blasters)_
    - 1 Lieutenant Guy _(Elite Brute)_
    - 8d | Boss Guy _(Boss Overseer)_

## Running Combat

When a fight breaks out, the action flows naturally, following the spotlight. There are no specific rules that differentiate combat from any other scene.

**_There's no turn order._** The GM describes the impending danger in the current situation and asks how the PCs respond, or the PCs take action on their own. The spotlight is often on the PCs, and the world's actions flow from what they do. You make enemies more proactive by _Foreshadowing_ events and following up after, or spending suspense to make impact moves. This results in a cinematic ebb and flow to combat.

**_Battles occur in the theater of the mind_**, using the
group's shared imagination to keep track of each participant's fictional positioning to map fiction to rules. However, using **_battlemaps_** or sketching maps with minis or markers to track locations during a fight works well, too. This helps organize the chaotic situation, makes sure everyone gets time to shine, and keeps everyone's imagination aligned. Don't get caught up in detailed tracking — update the map with big changes.

### Combat Rulings

You map the fiction to the rules just like any scene, making rulings to fill in gaps. However, in combat you'll often see the same scenarios come up, so for the sake of consistency, some common rulings:

**Movement**: Moving usually accompanies another action — the goal isn't just to get somewhere, but to get there and do something. If an interesting obstacle blocks the way, it needs an action roll.

**Weapons**: Compare the weapons in play and use common sense to resolve any issues. Most weapons are evenly matched; the roll only shifts if there's a clear imbalance.

**Melee combat**: Most melee attacks use Brawn, while light, fast weapons rely on Agility. Dirty tricks call for Wits, but rarely work more than once.

**Ranged combat**: Precision attacks roll Agility, while thrown weapons use Brawn or Agility based on weight and range. Charging an enemy with ranged weapons is reckless, adding +1t or requiring a separate action to close the gap.

**Defense Rolls**: The GM selects the stat to test. Melee attacks are dodged with Agility, blocked with Brawn (using armor or shields), anticipated with Wits, or keeping your nerve with Presence.

**Armor**: Armor and shields are represented by talents. Otherwise, they are vantage and set dressing for defense rolls.

**Vulnerabilities**: Exploiting a vulnerability can lower thorns, drop 1 before rolling a pool, or even bypass the need for a roll. In some cases, finding a vulnerability is required to attack at all.

**Ranged vs. Melee**: Precise ranged attacks demand focus, which is tough with nearby threats. Inflict +1t to these rolls when under immediate danger.
