  description: |
    You have bonds with the elements: **_Air_**, **_Earth_**, **_Fire_**, and **_Water_**. You have spellcasting, rolling Presence to call on an element, which serves as the touchstone. You can call on each element once per session, or twice if your bond is **_deep_**. Mark two usages of a single element to cast a potent spell. Combine usages of two elements to take +1d and both touchstones on the roll.
