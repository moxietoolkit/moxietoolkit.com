    Once per session, touch someone to link spirits. You can sense their feelings and know where they are. You can **push yourself** to: _assist them_—_speak into their mind_—_take mental damage for them_—_teleport to them_. If they get dropped, so do you. You must touch again or rest for the link to end. When it does, change your bond.
