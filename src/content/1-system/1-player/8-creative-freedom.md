## Set Dressing

Add minor, common sense details freely. Make assumptions and add _set dressing_ to scenes to play off of to keep things flowing dynamically. There's no need to check in with the GM - they'll step in if a detail goes beyond set dressing. Anything that's a _given_ for your vantage, like knowing someone or having equipment that makes sense, is set dressing.

## Tangles

Character-driven complications you introduce into a scene and have to follow-up on. In return, you take spark. Tangles must stem from your vantage or story arcs nad always have an immediate impact, like an action roll, an option closing off, or forcing inaction at an important moment. These are things like:

- **_Unwise decisions_** your PC would likely make.
- **_Personal motivations_** over group goals.
- **_Complications_** from beliefs or backstory.

## Story

_Pure cinematic momentum_. Each session you have **2 story**. Spend it to add **_story details_** that go beyond set dressing, creating new opportunities or shifting the scene in your favor. Added details must fit your vantage, _at least as a stretch_, or tie to a story arc. Example details:

- **_Character_**: Gear, contacts, backstory...
- **_Scene_**: NPC actions, objects, atmospherics...
- **_Setting_**: History, geography, factions...

Added details can't override rolls or contradict the established story. If your detail affects another PC, get permission. The GM can make a story roll to see how true or beneficial it is, or add nuance. On a grim, it may backfire! The GM can also veto details to keep things coherent.

There are _gray zones_ between set dressing, story details, and details simply too impactful to add. Set boundaries with your group.
