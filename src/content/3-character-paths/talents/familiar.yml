  description: |
    You manifest a small magical creature. You can communicate telepathically and send it on simple tasks, making a story roll to see how it goes. By entering a trance, you can use its senses. You can also **push yourself** to cast a spell through it. If your familiar takes damage, it vanishes and reappears at the start of the next session.
