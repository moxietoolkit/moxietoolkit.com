## Marks

Lesser damage, a temporary hindrance to a stat. **_Take +1t on the next roll with that stat, then clear the mark._**

If a stat is already marked, mark its paired stat instead. If both are already marked, take the related **harm**. Note that a mark can be taken even if you have the related harm.

Marks are often combined with another mark or other consequences when inflicted directly. You also take a mark when you **push yourself**.

## Harm

A hard hit your mind or body, general damage that doesn't need to be tracked in detail. **_This is the default damage from an impact move_**.

- Physical damage leaves you **bloodied**
- Mental damage leaves you **rattled**

**_Bloodied and rattled each inflict +1t on all rolls_**. However, when you have harm, you ignore thorns from marks to the related stats and the marks don't clear. Getting bloodied or rattled a second time leaves you **dropped** - you're out of the scene. Make a story roll (_usually 2d_) to see if you're just out temporarily, take a condition, or wind up dead.

Although bloodied and rattled are the default, especially dangerous attacks with **high risk** can lead straight to dropped, while **low risk** situations might leave you with a mark by default.

A messy defense roll leaves you with lesser damage - dropped becomes bloodied, rattled becomes a mark.

## Conditions

Specific injuries or maladies that impact only relevant situations and are often lasting. They often come combined with harm or a mark, and can be:

- **_Urgent_**.
- **_Short-term_**.
- **_Long-term_**.
- **_Permanent_**.

**_Take +1t when a condition specifically hinders a roll_**. It can also make an attempt impossible.

Conditions clear when it makes sense, life after a scene, with rest, or when a pool tracking them depletes. They may also require treatment or another specific method to clear them.

**_You have final say on long-term and permanent conditions_**. When you take one, work with the GM to find a good fit for your PC and the situation.

## Vex

An intense flash of emotion like _anger, fear, or confusion_. Vex is inflicted as a consequence, sometimes in addition to a mark or harm. **_You can also spend spark to take vex in place of rattled_**, if it fits the situation. Vex prompts an immediate, instinctive response. Choose one from **fight, flight, freeze** or **freakout**.

Interpret the response. Your PC is _driven by emotion_, but you decide how it plays out. Aim to balance what's fun and what fits the story. **_If there's a follow-up roll, take +1t on it_**. After the response, which always takes a beat or two, clear the vex.
