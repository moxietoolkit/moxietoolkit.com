  description: |
    Two small spheres of your magic path float around you. Give them 2 traits: _annoying_—_capricious_—_malevolent_—_mesmerizing_—_whimsical_. They serve as touchstones. You can sacrifice one to: _assist without risk_—_distract someone_—_suffer vex in your stead_. Make story rolls to determine effects if sacrificed. They return each session.
