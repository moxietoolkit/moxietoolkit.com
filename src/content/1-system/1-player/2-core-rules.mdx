## Core Mechanic

When things get _risky_ and _dramatic_, roll to see what happens. Grab a few d6 dice (_d_) equal to the stat the GM picks to test, roll them, and take the highest to determine the **outcome** - 6: **Perfect**, 4-5: **Messy**, 1-3: **Grim**.

- A **critical** happens when you roll two or more 6s. **_Ignore any cuts_** and choose a **critical bonus**: _greater effect_ - _secondary effect_ - _setup a follow up_.
- A **disaster** happens when a grim is cut by a **thorn**. Whatever the risk was before, _double it_ - the worst case scenario comes to pass.

## Thorns

One or two d8s (_t_) added to your roll by the GM to reflect a tougher than normal task. Each 7 or 8 on a thorn **cuts** a roll's outcome by one step - perfect becomes messy, messy becomes grim, grim becomes a disaster.

A normal roll is +0t/_tough_. The GM adds thorns with their _gut feeling_, given the situation. They can make it +1t/_very tough_ or +2t/_extremely tough_. If it's at +3t, the task can't be done - break it up into steps or try a new approach.

If needed, the GM can assess difficulty factors to determine how many thorns to add:

- **Intrinsic**: Scale, opposing skill, numbers...
- **External**: Environment, training, tools...
- **Intangible**: Strong feelings, bad information, a curse...

**Damage** to a PC also adds thorns to a roll, but they don't count towards making it _impossible_.

## Smooth Flow

If a grim threatens to grind the story to a halt, the GM can **keep things moving** - you get what you want, but in a way that makes things much worse. If a roll somehow turns out to have no effect, you learn new info or setup for a follow up.
